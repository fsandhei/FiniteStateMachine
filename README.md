#Finite State Machine
This repository contains a suggestion of how a state machine may be designed. 
It is template based, to make the implementation/realization much easier for the developer. 

##Motivation
As a state machine's implementation varies from developer to developer, this state machine offers a "standardized" initialization, so that the developer only has to add dependencies to the finite state machines's constructor.
